# Mouseworld Lab 

Mouseworld Lab is a space for exploring and building Network Digital Twins. Our repos focus on creating synthetic network environments, which reflect abstraction of the real world to experiment with different use cases, with the aim of optimizing and improving real networks based on these experiments.
